    <p>This will explain how to make a grilled cheese and how easy it is, and how it's really hard to fail at it and even a child could make it. Like, a very young, not-even-talking-age child could cook this successfully. Even if this child had a disability they could still make this.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread of your choice (2 per sandwich, unless you're making some kind of big mac like sandwich)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheese (your choice, more variety is always welcome)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a pan with some butter in it to medium heat</li>
        <li>throw your bread in the toaster on low just to get a light crunch</li>
        <li>Generously butter your lightly toasted bread on the outside surfaces of the sandwich</li>
        <li>cut your cheeses to a consistent-ish thickness and layer on an unbuttered side of bread</li>
        <li>Once the pan is to temp, put the loaded half of your sandwich in, buttered side down</li>
        <li>Place other slice of buttered bread on top of sandwich, buttered side up</li>
        <li>let cook for a minute or two, then carefully flip sandwich</li>
        <li>Once cheese is melted through, you're ready to eat! Just make sure to not burn the sandwich in the process</li>
    </ol>
